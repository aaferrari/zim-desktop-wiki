====== Source View ======

This plugin allows inserting 'Code Blocks' in the page. These will be shown as embedded widgets with syntax highlighting, line numbers etc.

**Dependencies:** This plugin depends on the ''gtksourceview'' package. On Ubuntu this dependency can be satisfied by installing the ''libgtksourceview-3.0'' package.

===== Options =====
This plugin has the following options:

If **Auto indenting** is enabled the widget will try to automatically set proper indenting while typing code.

If **Smart Home key** is enabled the ''Home'' key will go to the start of the line taking into account indenting.

If **Highlight current line** is enabled the current line in the widget is highlighted.

If **Show right margin** is enabled, there is a margin drawn on the right to guide maximum length of a line. Typically the margin is set at e.g. 72 or 80 characters.

**Text wrap mode** allows you to choose between the following options:
* **Wrap lines never**: Lines are never broken when the visible limit of the block is reached.
* **Wrap at character boundaries**: Default, the lines are broken taking into account the characters that reach the row limit of the block.
* **Wrap at word boundaries**: The lines are broken taking into account the words that reach the row limit of the block.
* **Wrap at word and character boundaries**: The lines are broken taking into account the characters and words that reach the row limit of the block.

**Right margin position** gives the position of the right margin in characters.

**Tab width** gives the width of a tab in spaces.
